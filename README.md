# css-layout-project3

One of projects to master css.

This time I was working on RWD with CSS Flex/Grid layout.

It's fully copy of spotify layout just to train more complex layouts.

Working on this layout gave me a lot of joy because of the extra work,
I did with my wife to make unique music album covers.

Have a great day!
